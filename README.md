*DESCRIPTION*:<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This real-time chat application is developed as part of CODTECH Internship Task 2 and demonstrates the creation of an interactive communication system using Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.IO. The goal of this project is to build a fully functional chat environment where multiple users can connect, exchange messages instantly, and experience smooth bidirectional communication without page refreshes. WebSockets serve as the backbone of this application, enabling continuous, event-based data transmission between the client and server. Socket.IO simplifies WebSocket handling, allowing the application to remain fast, responsive, and reliable even in multi-user scenarios.

The application runs locally on localhost and does not require deployment to an online server to meet the internship requirements. It provides an efficient and modern chat interface that enables users to enter a username, optionally join a specific room, and immediately begin interacting with others in real-time. Once a user joins, the interface updates to display the active users in that room, and system-generated events are broadcast notifying others when someone enters or leaves the chat. These join and leave alerts improve interactivity and give users a clear sense of room activity.

A key feature of this project is the typing indicator, which detects when a user begins typing and broadcasts this activity to all other participants in the same room. This helps users feel more engaged by providing a real-time cue that someone else is preparing a message. Every chat message, typing event, and system notification is handled through Socket.IO events, forming a smooth communication pipeline. Message timestamps ensure clarity and help users keep track of conversations, while the lightweight UI design focuses on readability and simplicity.

On the frontend, the project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a clean, responsive layout that adapts well to different screen sizes. The interface includes input fields for username and room selection, a scrolling chat message container, an active user panel, and a message composition area. The styling is minimal yet modern, offering a dark-themed interface consistent with contemporary chat application aesthetics. The goal is to deliver a user-friendly chat experience that remains easy to understand and navigate.
